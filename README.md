# Effects Pedal Wranger

## What is it?

The *Effects Pedal Wranger* is a C# application that will help guitar players keep track of their pedal boards and different 'presets' for different songs/sets.
Right now, it's a work in progress, but stay tuned for more info in the future!

## What's the plan?

* I'm building this application using *Testing Driven Development*, stubbing out class fields and writing unit tests before writing the code.
* I'll be writing classes to represent individual settings for pedals, the pedals themselves, a pedalboard (collection of pedals), and a preset (specific settings loaded on a pedalboard).
* Right now, the goal is to make a command line app for creating these pedals, pedalboards, and presets and serializing them to local storage for later recall.
